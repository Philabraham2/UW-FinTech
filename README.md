# UW-FinTech
## My name is Phil Abraham

My background is primarily in Finance. I recieved my bachelors and masters in Finance from *Pacific Lutheran University*

---

My career goals are to find a job that allows me to utilize both my financial acumen and computer coding, primarily in the field of finance.

---

I chose FinTech as my career path because I enjoy the challenges and complex nature of finance and I understand the need and usefulness of computer coding and technology as the way of the future. I want to integrate the two in my career and work to help shape the FinTech landscape in the future.
